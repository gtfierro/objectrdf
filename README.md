[![Docs](https://github.com/gtfierro/plumb/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://gtfierro.github.io/plumb/)

Describe water and wastewater treatment plants as plain, typed Python and
get RDF that conforms to the [WATR](https://github.com/DataDrivenCPS/water-ontology)
water treatment ontology and [ASHRAE 223P](https://open223.info), which it
builds on. No RDF in user code; real Turtle out.

Bundled ontologies: WATR v0.3.0.rc1 (a release candidate whose terms may still
change before 0.3.0), ASHRAE 223P (v1.0.0-2026), and the QUDT units and
quantity kinds they use. Domain packages for drinking water, activated sludge
(ASM2d), and seawater reverse osmosis come compiled from SHACL.

```python
from plumb import Model, connect, flowsheet
from plumb.qudt import quantity_kinds, units
from plumb.watr import Pump
from plumb.watr.drinking_water import ClarificationStage, CoagulationStage

with Model("urn:example:plant#") as model:
    intake = Pump("intake-pump")
    coagulation = CoagulationStage("coagulation")
    clarifier = ClarificationStage("clarifier")

raw_water = connect(intake, coagulation.inlet, name="raw-water")
connect(coagulation.outlet, clarifier.inlet, name="coagulated-water")
raw_water.sensor("raw-water-flow", kind=quantity_kinds.VolumeFlowRate, unit=units.M3_PER_DAY)

model.save("plant.ttl")      # connection points and pipes are worked out for you
print(model.validate())      # SHACL via shifty; errors name your objects
flowsheet(model).save("plant.svg")
```

The ontology classes are generated code, so editors and type checkers see
everything: completion, ontology definitions on hover, and type errors when a
link's range doesn't fit.

Saved models load back as the same objects, and can be searched by class,
medium, or role, or walked along the flow:

```python
from plumb.watr import enums

plant = Model.from_graph("plant.ttl")
plant["intake-pump"].find_all_next(through={"medium": enums.values.Fluid_Water})
```

## Install and run the examples

Plumb requires Python 3.12 or newer. From a checkout of this repository,
install the project and its dependencies with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync
```

Then run an example from the repository root:

```bash
uv run python examples/watr/treatment/watr_quickstart.py
uv run python examples/watr/asm2d/watertap_asm2d.py
uv run python examples/watr/seawater_ro/watertap_seawater_ro_full.py
```

Each example prints a short summary and writes its generated Turtle file next
to the example script. See [examples/](examples/) for more scenarios.

- Documentation: [the learning book](https://gtfierro.github.io/plumb/)
  (tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and API reference; build it locally
  with `make docs`)
- Start with [modelling a treatment train](docs/book/tutorials/watr-treatment.md)
  and [characterizing and instrumenting a plant](docs/book/tutorials/watr-instrumented-plant.md);
  [an S223 air path](docs/book/tutorials/s223-air-path.md) shows the same API
  on a 223P building system

## Domain configurations and quantities

Reusable equipment layouts and property metadata are defined in RDF and SHACL.
The compiler generates typed configurations and immutable value schemas:

```python
from plumb.qudt import QuantityAmount as Q, units
from plumb.watr.asm2d import AerobicStage, AerobicDesign, OxygenOutletState

with Model("urn:example:reactor#") as model:
    reactor = AerobicStage("R5")
    reactor.apply_properties(AerobicDesign(oxygen_transfer_coefficient=10.0))
    reactor.outlet.apply_properties(
        OxygenOutletState(oxygen_concentration=Q(1.91, units.GM_PER_M3))
    )
```

Bare values use shape-declared units; explicit quantities preserve their units.
The same `apply_properties(...)` API works on equipment, points, and connections.
Use `subject.quantity(...)` for individual values. `capability=` selects static,
observable, or actuatable properties; `has_aspect=` supplies their interpretation.

See [domain extensions](docs/book/explanation/domain-extensions.md), the
[ASM2d tutorial](docs/book/tutorials/domain-configurations.md), and the
[extension compiler reference](docs/book/reference/extension-compiler.md).
Regenerate the supplied domains with
`uv run python scripts/generate_example_domains.py`.

## Development

The Makefile wraps the standard development commands:

```bash
make setup          # install development and documentation dependencies
make check          # lint, type checks, and tests
make docs           # build the documentation and execute tutorials
make docs-open      # build and open the HTML documentation
make docs-check     # full documentation build; warnings are errors
make build          # source distribution and wheel, replacing dist/
make dist-check     # build, check metadata, and smoke-test the wheel
make regen          # regenerate the supplied domain packages from local SHACL
make help           # all available targets
```

Use `make test TEST_ARGS="-q tests/test_named_points.py"` to select tests.
`make format` formats source while excluding generated ontology output.
`make clean` removes documentation, build output, and tool caches.
To release, bump `version` in `pyproject.toml`, date the release in
`CHANGELOG.md`, tag the commit `v<version>`, and publish a GitHub release
from the tag. The release workflow runs the checks, builds the
distributions, publishes them to PyPI, and attaches them to the release.

To regenerate the committed ontology packages, see [docs/codegen.md](docs/codegen.md).
