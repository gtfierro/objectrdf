"""Deferred 223-style connection intentions.

Generated classes eagerly create only connection points whose shape fixes a
single medium. ``connect(a, b)`` records an intention; ``Model.resolve()`` (or
``graph()``, ``save()``, and ``validate()``) delegates layout, medium, point,

an immutable resolved snapshot, leaving the authored model unchanged.
